# PokemonSPA

Welcome to the Pok√©mon Single Page Application (SPA) project! This application is a collaborative effort developed using JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap and jQuery. It utilizes the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, comprising controllers, views, and services to deliver an immersive Pokedex experience.


### Status
üöß Under Construction: Please note that this application is currently under development. While many features are functional, some components are still being refined and improved. Your patience and understanding are appreciated as we work to enhance the user experience.

### Planned Changes
Card Controller: This component is currently under construction and will be available soon to provide each Pok√©mon info.  
API Update: We're in the process of updating the API to retrieve data for all Pok√©mon, not just limited to the first generation.  
About Us Section: Stay tuned for the upcoming "About Us" section, where you'll get to know more about the team behind this project.

### Future Goals
Modernizing and standardizing the technologies used in this project to ensure scalability, efficiency, and maintainability.
