# PokemonSPA

Welcome to the Pok√©mon Single Page Application (SPA) project! This application is a collaborative effort developed using JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap and jQuery. It utilizes the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, comprising controllers, views, and services to deliver an immersive Pokedex experience.


### Status
üöß Under Construction: Please note that this application is currently under development. While many features are functional, some components are still being refined and improved.

### Planned Changes
API Update: We're in the process of updating the API to retrieve data for all Pok√©mon, not just limited to the first generation.
Modernizing and standardizing the technologies used in this project to ensure scalability, efficiency, and maintainability.
